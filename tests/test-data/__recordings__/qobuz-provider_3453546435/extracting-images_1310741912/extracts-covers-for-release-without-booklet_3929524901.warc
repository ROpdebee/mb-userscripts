Although their previous records had some popular success, they never even hinted at the massive sales of Breakfast in America. Then again, Supertramp's earlier records weren't as pop-oriented as Breakfast. The majority of the album consisted of tightly written, catchy, well-constructed pop songs, like the hits \"The Logical Song,\" \"Take the Long Way Home,\" and \"Goodbye Stranger.\" Supertramp still had a tendency to indulge themselves occasionally, but Breakfast in America had very few weak moments. It was clearly their high-water mark.\n<br \/>&copy  Stephen Thomas Erlewine \/TiVo","released_at":291510000,"product_sales_factors_monthly":5.5,"release_tags":["remaster"],"title":"Breakfast In America","duration":2774,"parental_warning":false,"artists":[{"id":50242,"name":"Supertramp","roles":["main-artist"]}],"popularity":0,"genre":{"id":119,"color":"#5eabc1","name":"Rock","path":[112,119],"slug":"rock"},"catchline":"","id":"0060075330437","slug":"breakfast-in-america-supertramp","image":{"large":"https:\/\/static.qobuz.com\/images\/covers\/37\/04\/0060075330437_600.jpg","small":"https:\/\/static.qobuz.com\/images\/covers\/37\/04\/0060075330437_230.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/static.qobuz.com\/images\/covers\/37\/04\/0060075330437_50.jpg","back":null},"composer":{"id":573076,"name":"Various Composers","slug":"various-composers","albums_count":583621,"picture":null,"image":null},"upc":"0060075330437","release_type":"album","label":{"id":1211,"name":"A&M","slug":"a-m","supplier_id":1,"albums_count":1507},"product_sales_factors_yearly":66.6,"qobuz_id":3224387,"version":"Remastered","url":"https:\/\/www.qobuz.com\/nl-nl\/album\/breakfast-in-america-supertramp\/0060075330437","is_official":true,"relative_url":"\/album\/breakfast-in-america-supertramp\/0060075330437","product_type":"album","awards":[{"slug":"qobuz","award_slug":"discotheque_ideale","name":"The Qobuz Ideal Discography","awarded_at":1401573600,"award_id":"70","publication_id":"2","publication_name":"Qobuz","publication_slug":"qobuz"}],"subtitle":"Supertramp","tracks_count":10,"maximum_channel_count":2,"maximum_sampling_rate":44.1,"articles":[{"id":2645395,"url":"\/order\/2645395","price":12.49,"currency":"EUR","type":"lls","label":"Cd-kwaliteit","description":"Lossless, 16-bits\/44,1 kHz (FLAC, ALAC, WMA, AIFF, WAV)"}],"release_date_original":"1979-03-29","release_date_download":"1979-03-29","release_date_stream":"1979-03-29","purchasable":true,"streamable":false,"previewable":true,"sampleable":true,"downloadable":true,"displayable":true,"purchasable_at":1638399600,"streamable_at":1638399600,"hires":false,"hires_streamable":false,"tracks":{"offset":0,"limit":20,"total":10,"items":[{"maximum_bit_depth":16,"copyright":"\u2117 2010 A&M Records","performers":"Peter Henderson, Producer, Engineer, Mastering Engineer, StudioPersonnel - RICK DAVIES, Keyboards, Vocalist, AssociatedPerformer, ComposerLyricist - ROGER HODGSON, Guitar, Keyboards, Vocalist, AssociatedPerformer, ComposerLyricist - Jeff Harris, Engineer, StudioPersonnel - Dougie Thomson, Bass Guitar, AssociatedPerformer - Supertramp, Producer, MainArtist - Lenise Bent, Asst.
