Your fanaticism my strength
And prove me now herewith, saith the lord of hosts
I will bring down your enemies, the rust that destroys
No famine will race your land, as long as you bow

Bring me ye all the tithes into the storehouse
That there may be meat in mine house
Bring your treasures, feed my belly
Off all you make, come make me rich
I’ll do no effort just my preach will be enough to possess you

Fear my anger for your rebellion
I punish the thieves
And dammed are you all, of my flock black sheep&#39;s

Bring me ye all the tithes into the storehouse
That there may be meat in mine house
Bring your treasures, feed my belly
Off all you make, come make me rich
I’ll do no effort, sacrifice your offerings, make me your god</div>

Your screams never been Heard
Brutalized hatred from within

Upon the darkened throne

Digging up your tomb

Desperation 
Blood spilled in vain
The consciousness betrays you
Illusion clouds the perception
Now you’re dead to rot

Pain all around you
Driving you insane
Hosts of evil darkness
Carving your casket with hate

Turned to beast, disfigured intelligence, who is the animal now

No blood pressure can be measured 
Spirit off the body , the senses away
Suicide calls from hell, the heaven path, who cares?
Worms are suppurated from inside out
Not even dead the soul spreads its stench

I can Smell the death
I can see the grotesque end
I picture the dismemberment 
An image of self hate

Feel the pain taking the body, boiling the guts
Drain the body until the darkness  embraces you
Taste the delirium of torture, smile to the dead
Cross the threshold of pleasure and pain, red-painted floor, No remorse, only satisfaction 
let the demons out
Not even dead the soul spreads its stench

I can Smell the death
I can see the grotesque end
I picture the dismemberment 
An image of self hate

No fear to the unknown
Afterlife is the last concern
As the last breath is gone 
Not even dead the soul spreads its ……

The agony is over
You can see your  deceased body lying  on the floor 
The piece of art is complete for the pictures to come 
Another dead body that no one cares 
Now that you’re dead your corpse spreads its stench

I can Smell the death
I can see the grotesque end
I picture the dismemberment 
An image of self hate</div>

It’s tearing my soul apart
Hatefully burning inside this craving to kill
And spit on your decrepit face
Retribution will come, the day I’ll see you bleed
My hands around your neck
No longer will the air run into your throat
Neither will your heart beat

Creep, no one hear you scream
Weep, it brings me ecstasy
Pray, your god won’t save you now

Driven to the woods where silence will increase the nerves
Despair in your eyes, the look of fear as you beg for pity- tears of terror
Too late for regrets, time for repentance has expired-no forgiveness
I’ll torture you to death I’ll satisfy my thirst for vengeance
Thirst for killing, thirst for your death

Desmembration, torture pleasure, vengeance frenzy, twisted hatred


I won’t dignify your suffering with my semen
Only want to release my fury in your dying body- worthless pig
I’ll cut you up after death, put your members into the ditch-rotten inside
So sweet to urinate the sanctuary of your putrid carcass
Rot in peace you piece of shit

Gone forever, worm devoured, rigor mortis, decomposing
Shredded body, faceless monster, dead and buried, be forgotten

Creep, no one hear you scream
Weep, it brings me ecstasy

Course of Human Destruction by INHUMAN, released 01 April 2013

Bloodshed and warfare race the land
Piles of bodies fill the open ground
Screams of terror, historical demise
Genocidal trend to rule the world

Cain son of death, devil
Domination hate, obscure
Flying, aiming, shooting
Loading, bombing, blasting

Abel blood to dust, murder
Serpent spirit creeps, disease
Flying, aiming, shooting
Loading, bombing, blasting

Fetid horseman rides, reaper
Radiation wave, deformed
Killing, crushing, burning
Destroying the living, exploding

Only rats remain, ruin
No man’s land domain, desert

            <div class="tralbumData lyricsText">Bloodshed and warfare race the land<br>
Piles of bodies fill the open ground<br>
Screams of terror, historical demise<br>
Genocidal trend to rule the world<br>
<br>
Cain son of death, devil<br>
Domination hate, obscure<br>
Flying, aiming, shooting<br>
Loading, bombing, blasting<br>
<br>
Abel blood to dust, murder<br>
Serpent spirit creeps, disease<br>
Flying, aiming, shooting<br>
Loading, bombing, blasting<br>
<br>
Fetid horseman rides, reaper<br>
Radiation wave, deformed<br>
Killing, crushing, burning<br>
Destroying the living, exploding<br>
<br>
Only rats remain, ruin<br>
No man’s land domain, desert</div>

Dead to Rot by INHUMAN, released 01 April 2013

Torn to pieces
Desolation bleeds the sky
Your screams never been Heard
Brutalized hatred from within 

Tongue spelling ashes
Upon the darkened throne
Behold the faces of mockery
Digging up your tomb

Desperation 
Blood spilled in vain
The consciousness betrays you
Illusion clouds the perception
Now you’re dead to rot

Pain all around you
Driving you insane
Hosts of evil darkness
Carving your casket with hate

Desperation 
Now you’re dead to rot

Desolation bleeds the sky<br>
Your screams never been Heard<br>
Brutalized hatred from within <br>

Tongue spelling ashes<br>
Upon the darkened throne<br>
Behold the faces of mockery<br>
Digging up your tomb<br>

Desperation <br>
Blood spilled in vain<br>
The consciousness betrays you<br>
Illusion clouds the perception<br>
Now you’re dead to rot<br>

Pain all around you<br>
Driving you insane<br>
Hosts of evil darkness<br>
Carving your casket with hate<br>

Shame on You by INHUMAN, released 01 April 2013

Shame on you, shame on your existence
When they suffer our planet burns
as done to them shall be done to you
retribution will persuit your head

you have exterminated with no regret , shame on you
you’ve killed living creatures with no defense

No amount of money justifies 
Your nasty greed and mutilation
The ivory tusk shall be piercing you
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth

you have exterminated with no regret , shame on you
you’ve killed living creatures with no defense

Hear  the sounds of the dying species

Skinned bodies left behind to fulfill greedy needs
Sick ambition, luxury, no respect for the weak
Shall the Earth take revenge and turn you into prey
Turned to beast, disfigured intelligence, who is the animal now


Fat to warm a swarm of shit, frenzy to devour
Oceans cry, equilibrium brakes, destruction chain
Shall your carrion be fed to the insects
As their helpless eyes are consumed by  horrific pain

Shame on you, shame on your existence
When they suffer our planet burns
as done to them shall be done to you
retribution will persuit your head

you have exterminated with no regret , shame on you
you’ve killed living creatures with no defense

No amount of money justifies 
Your nasty greed and mutilation
The ivory tusk shall be piercing you
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth

you have exterminated with no regret , shame on you
you’ve killed living creatures with no defense

            <div class="tralbumData lyricsText">Shame on you, shame on your existence<br>
When they suffer our planet burns<br>
as done to them shall be done to you<br>
retribution will persuit your head<br>
<br>
you have exterminated with no regret , shame on you<br>
you’ve killed living creatures with no defense<br>
<br>
No amount of money justifies <br>
Your nasty greed and mutilation<br>
The ivory tusk shall be piercing you<br>
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth<br>
<br>
you have exterminated with no regret , shame on you<br>
you’ve killed living creatures with no defense<br>
<br>
Hear  the sounds of the dying species<br>
<br>
Skinned bodies left behind to fulfill greedy needs<br>
Sick ambition, luxury, no respect for the weak<br>
Shall the Earth take revenge and turn you into prey<br>
Turned to beast, disfigured intelligence, who is the animal now<br>
<br>
<br>
Fat to warm a swarm of shit, frenzy to devour<br>
Oceans cry, equilibrium brakes, destruction chain<br>
Shall your carrion be fed to the insects<br>
As their helpless eyes are consumed by  horrific pain<br>
<br>
Shame on you, shame on your existence<br>
When they suffer our planet burns<br>
as done to them shall be done to you<br>
retribution will persuit your head<br>
<br>
you have exterminated with no regret , shame on you<br>
you’ve killed living creatures with no defense<br>
<br>
No amount of money justifies <br>
Your nasty greed and mutilation<br>
The ivory tusk shall be piercing you<br>
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth<br>
<br>
you have exterminated with no regret , shame on you<br>
you’ve killed living creatures with no defense</div>

Blood Obsessed by INHUMAN, released 01 April 2013

Burning shapes of shadows among our souls
Death whispers and surrounds us 
Bleeding feeds our twisted thirst for gore
Graves have become altars
Carnage seduces us with its deadly call
Torture fills our minds with 
Pleasure that will penetrate the bone
Immersing us into madness

Sick existence
Violence control
Blood obsessed
Essence of decay

Scenes of terror satisfy our lust
The hunger cannot wait
Inspiration comes from inner tombs
Hidden putrid scent 
No mercy for the dying race
Human corpses rotting
We contemplate and search for more
Fill our guts with rottenness  

Burning shapes of shadows among our souls
Death whispers and surrounds us 
Bleeding feeds our twisted thirst for gore
Graves have become altars
Carnage seduces us with its deadly call
Torture fills our minds with 
Pleasure that will penetrate the bone
Immersing us into madness

Sick existence
Violence control
Blood obsessed
Essence of decay

Death whispers and surrounds us <br>
Bleeding feeds our twisted thirst for gore<br>
Graves have become altars<br>
Carnage seduces us with its deadly call<br>
Torture fills our minds with <br>
Pleasure that will penetrate the bone<br>
Immersing us into madness<br>
<br>
Sick existence<br>
Violence control<br>
Blood obsessed<br>
Essence of decay<br>
<br>
Scenes of terror satisfy our lust<br>
The hunger cannot wait<br>
Inspiration comes from inner tombs<br>
Hidden putrid scent <br>
No mercy for the dying race<br>
Human corpses rotting<br>
We contemplate and search for more<br>
Fill our guts with rottenness  <br>
<br>
Burning shapes of shadows among our souls<br>
Death whispers and surrounds us <br>
Bleeding feeds our twisted thirst for gore<br>
Graves have become altars<br>
Carnage seduces us with its deadly call<br>
Torture fills our minds with <br>
Pleasure that will penetrate the bone<br>
Immersing us into madness<br>

Priest INC. by INHUMAN, released 01 April 2013

Obey these commandments I inflict on you
Your fanaticism my strength
And prove me now herewith, saith the lord of hosts
I will bring down your enemies, the rust that destroys
No famine will race your land, as long as you bow

Bring me ye all the tithes into the storehouse
That there may be meat in mine house
Bring your treasures, feed my belly
Off all you make, come make me rich
I’ll do no effort just my preach will be enough to possess you

Fear my anger for your rebellion
I punish the thieves
And dammed are you all, of my flock black sheep&amp;#39;s

Bring me ye all the tithes into the storehouse
That there may be meat in mine house
Bring your treasures, feed my belly
Off all you make, come make me rich
I’ll do no effort, sacrifice your offerings, make me your god

Your fanaticism my strength<br>
And prove me now herewith, saith the lord of hosts<br>
I will bring down your enemies, the rust that destroys<br>
No famine will race your land, as long as you bow<br>
<br>
Bring me ye all the tithes into the storehouse<br>
That there may be meat in mine house<br>
Bring your treasures, feed my belly<br>
Off all you make, come make me rich<br>
I’ll do no effort just my preach will be enough to possess you<br>
<br>
Fear my anger for your rebellion<br>
I punish the thieves<br>
And dammed are you all, of my flock black sheep&#39;s<br>
<br>
Bring me ye all the tithes into the storehouse<br>
That there may be meat in mine house<br>
Bring your treasures, feed my belly<br>
Off all you make, come make me rich<br>
I’ll do no effort, sacrifice your offerings, make me your god</div>

I Can Smell the Death by INHUMAN, released 01 April 2013

Trapped in the morgue the heart beating high
No blood pressure can be measured 
Spirit off the body , the senses away
Suicide calls from hell, the heaven path, who cares?
Worms are suppurated from inside out
Not even dead the soul spreads its stench

I can Smell the death
I can see the grotesque end
I picture the dismemberment 
An image of self hate

Feel the pain taking the body, boiling the guts
Drain the body until the darkness  embraces you
Taste the delirium of torture, smile to the dead
Cross the threshold of pleasure and pain, red-painted floor, No remorse, only satisfaction 
let the demons out
Not even dead the soul spreads its stench

I can Smell the death
I can see the grotesque end
I picture the dismemberment 
An image of self hate

No fear to the unknown
Afterlife is the last concern
As the last breath is gone 
Not even dead the soul spreads its ……

The agony is over
You can see your  deceased body lying  on the floor 
The piece of art is complete for the pictures to come 
Another dead body that no one cares 
Now that you’re dead your corpse spreads its stench

I can Smell the death
I can see the grotesque end
I picture the dismemberment 
An image of self hate

in the morgue the heart beating high\r\nNo blood pressure can be measured \r\nSpirit off the body , the senses away\r\nSuicide calls from hell, the heaven path, who cares?\r\nWorms are suppurated from inside out\r\nNot even dead the soul spreads its stench\r\n\r\nI can Smell the death\r\nI can see the grotesque end\r\nI picture the dismemberment \r\nAn image of self hate\r\n\r\nFeel the pain taking the body, boiling the guts\r\nDrain the body until the darkness  embraces you\r\nTaste the delirium of torture, smile to the dead\r\nCross the threshold of pleasure and pain, red-painted floor, No remorse, only satisfaction \r\nlet the demons out\r\nNot even dead the soul spreads its stench\r\n\r\nI can Smell the death\r\nI can see the grotesque end\r\nI picture the dismemberment \r\nAn image of self hate\r\n\r\nNo fear to the unknown\r\nAfterlife is the last concern\r\nAs the last breath is gone \r\nNot even dead the soul spreads its ……\r\n\r\nThe agony is over\r\nYou can see your  deceased body lying  on the floor \r\nThe piece of art is complete for the pictures to come \r\nAnother dead body that no one cares \r\nNow that you’re dead your corpse spreads its stench\r\n\r\nI can Smell the death\r\nI can see the grotesque end\r\nI picture the dismemberment \r\nAn image of self

in the morgue the heart beating high\r\nNo blood pressure can be measured \r\nSpirit off the body , the senses away\r\nSuicide calls from hell, the heaven path, who cares?\r\nWorms are suppurated from inside out\r\nNot even dead the soul spreads its stench\r\n\r\nI can Smell the death\r\nI can see the grotesque end\r\nI picture the dismemberment \r\nAn image of self hate\r\n\r\nFeel the pain taking the body, boiling the guts\r\nDrain the body until the darkness  embraces you\r\nTaste the delirium of torture, smile to the dead\r\nCross the threshold of pleasure and pain, red-painted floor, No remorse, only satisfaction \r\nlet the demons out\r\nNot even dead the soul spreads its stench\r\n\r\nI can Smell the death\r\nI can see the grotesque end\r\nI picture the dismemberment \r\nAn image of self hate\r\n\r\nNo fear to the unknown\r\nAfterlife is the last concern\r\nAs the last breath is gone \r\nNot even dead the soul spreads its ……\r\n\r\nThe agony is over\r\nYou can see your  deceased body lying  on the floor \r\nThe piece of art is complete for the pictures to come \r\nAnother dead body that no one cares \r\nNow that you’re dead your corpse spreads its stench\r\n\r\nI can Smell the death\r\nI can see the grotesque end\r\nI picture the dismemberment \r\nAn image of self

            <div class="tralbumData lyricsText">Trapped in the morgue the heart beating high<br>
No blood pressure can be measured <br>
Spirit off the body , the senses away<br>
Suicide calls from hell, the heaven path, who cares?<br>
Worms are suppurated from inside out<br>
Not even dead the soul spreads its stench<br>
<br>
I can Smell the death<br>
I can see the grotesque end<br>
I picture the dismemberment <br>
An image of self hate<br>
<br>
Feel the pain taking the body, boiling the guts<br>
Drain the body until the darkness  embraces you<br>
Taste the delirium of torture, smile to the dead<br>
Cross the threshold of pleasure and pain, red-painted floor, No remorse, only satisfaction <br>
let the demons out<br>
Not even dead the soul spreads its stench<br>
<br>
I can Smell the death<br>
I can see the grotesque end<br>
I picture the dismemberment <br>
An image of self hate<br>
<br>
No fear to the unknown<br>
Afterlife is the last concern<br>
As the last breath is gone <br>
Not even dead the soul spreads its ……<br>
<br>
The agony is over<br>
You can see your  deceased body lying  on the floor <br>
The piece of art is complete for the pictures to come <br>
Another dead body that no one cares <br>
Now that you’re dead your corpse spreads its stench<br>
<br>
I can Smell the death<br>
I can see the grotesque end<br>
I picture the dismemberment <br>
An image of self hate</div>

Vomit on the Cross by INHUMAN, released 01 April 2013

Forgive father for I have sinned
I&amp;#39;ve killed and murdered
I&amp;#39;ve spread disease
Speak your useless words
So I can go and kill again
Override my depravity
Bring me spiritual release

With this my prayer I clean your sin
I give you purity, I set you free
I wash your rapist cock from the genital skin
Of the victims you raped 
You’re free to massacre again

In the name of Jesus I absolve you
Open the gates to hell
Watch my cynical devotion
Vomit on the cross

I&#39;ve killed and murdered<br>
I&#39;ve spread disease<br>
Speak your useless words<br>
So I can go and kill again<br>
Override my depravity<br>
Bring me spiritual release<br>
<br>
With this my prayer I clean your sin<br>
I give you purity, I set you free<br>
I wash your rapist cock from the genital skin<br>
Of the victims you raped <br>
You’re free to massacre again<br>
<br>
In the name of Jesus I absolve you<br>
Open the gates to hell<br>
Watch my cynical devotion<br>
Vomit on the cross</div>

Vengeance by INHUMAN, released 01 April 2013

It wants to come out to unleash a realm of blood
It’s tearing my soul apart
Hatefully burning inside this craving to kill
And spit on your decrepit face
Retribution will come, the day I’ll see you bleed
My hands around your neck
No longer will the air run into your throat
Neither will your heart beat

Creep, no one hear you scream
Weep, it brings me ecstasy
Pray, your god won’t save you now

Driven to the woods where silence will increase the nerves
Despair in your eyes, the look of fear as you beg for pity- tears of terror
Too late for regrets, time for repentance has expired-no forgiveness
I’ll torture you to death I’ll satisfy my thirst for vengeance
Thirst for killing, thirst for your death

Desmembration, torture pleasure, vengeance frenzy, twisted hatred


I won’t dignify your suffering with my semen
Only want to release my fury in your dying body- worthless pig
I’ll cut you up after death, put your members into the ditch-rotten inside
So sweet to urinate the sanctuary of your putrid carcass
Rot in peace you piece of shit

Gone forever, worm devoured, rigor mortis, decomposing
Shredded body, faceless monster, dead and buried, be forgotten

Creep, no one hear you scream
Weep, it brings me ecstasy
Pray, your god won’t save you now

            <div class="tralbumData lyricsText">It wants to come out to unleash a realm of blood<br>
It’s tearing my soul apart<br>
Hatefully burning inside this craving to kill<br>
And spit on your decrepit face<br>
Retribution will come, the day I’ll see you bleed<br>
My hands around your neck<br>
No longer will the air run into your throat<br>
Neither will your heart beat<br>
<br>
Creep, no one hear you scream<br>
Weep, it brings me ecstasy<br>
Pray, your god won’t save you now<br>
<br>
Driven to the woods where silence will increase the nerves<br>
Despair in your eyes, the look of fear as you beg for pity- tears of terror<br>
Too late for regrets, time for repentance has expired-no forgiveness<br>
I’ll torture you to death I’ll satisfy my thirst for vengeance<br>
Thirst for killing, thirst for your death<br>
<br>
Desmembration, torture pleasure, vengeance frenzy, twisted hatred<br>
<br>
<br>
I won’t dignify your suffering with my semen<br>
Only want to release my fury in your dying body- worthless pig<br>
I’ll cut you up after death, put your members into the ditch-rotten inside<br>
So sweet to urinate the sanctuary of your putrid carcass<br>
Rot in peace you piece of shit<br>
<br>
Gone forever, worm devoured, rigor mortis, decomposing<br>
Shredded body, faceless monster, dead and buried, be forgotten<br>
<br>
Creep, no one hear you scream<br>
Weep, it brings me ecstasy<br>
Pray, your god won’t save you now</div>
