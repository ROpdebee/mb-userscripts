    The Circle of Light project - funded by Youth Music - brought together 20 music industry professionals led by award-winning rapper Scor-Zay-Zee to mentor around 60 young people through the process of producing a powerful and eclectic album with tracks created over three intense weeks.

Tricia Gardiner, project co-ordinator, said: “We are so proud of everyone who has been involved in Circle of Light. The collaborations and relationships that have been formed have been amazing. It’s so important to give young people a platform to speak out about mental health and use it as a way to help others who may be facing their own struggles too. That’s not to say the resulting album is in any way gloomy, it’s a joyful exploration of all aspects of human life and features everything from folk and hip hop to raps and heartfelt ballads.”

Scorzayzee said: “I&#x27;m completely blown away by what we achieved in three weeks. There is something special that happens when you put people together who all have a similar interest or

something in common. Beyond all the music, what we had was people jumping out of bed in the morning and racing to get to the studio and leaving with a smile. Some people just need a little boost and inspiration, that can be life changing. We also have a world class album, in my opinion one of the best albums to ever come out of our city.&quot;
